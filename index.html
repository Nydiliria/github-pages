                        <p> Yesterwynde is the newest release from Nightwish and quickly became one of my favourite
                            albums
                            from
                            the
                            band. It has a pretty optimistic outlook on life, where some other albums can sometimes can
                            get
                            a
                            bit
                            darker.
                            Tracks like 'An ocean of strange islands' and 'The children of Ata' keep the heavier yet
                            melodic
                            sounds
                            of the 30 years of Nightwish perfectly in mind. And tracks like 'Sway' and 'Lanternlight'
                            keep a
                            softer
                            sound but keep their distinct Nightwish lyrics and melody.

                        <p> "Dark Passion Play" is the sixth studio album by the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish,
                            released in
                            2007. The album marks the debut of vocalist Anette Olzon and features a blend of orchestral
                            elements,
                            heavy guitar riffs, and lush melodies. Thematically, it explores concepts like love, loss,
                            and
                            the
                            struggle of depression, encapsulated in a narrative that unfolds across the tracks. Key
                            songs include "Amaranth," "Bye Bye Beautiful," and the epic "The Poet and the Pendulum," The
                            latter
                            being a 14 minute long song about the depression and 'musical suicide' of pianist and
                            componist
                            Tuomas
                            Holopianen following massive fan backlash from firing the first singer Tarja. Even the prime
                            minister of
                            Finland got involved in the outrage. </p>

                        <p> "Endless Forms Most Beautiful," released in 2015, is the eighth studio album by Nightwish
                            and
                            features
                            vocalist Floor Jansen. The album combines symphonic metal with progressive elements and
                            lyrical
                            themes
                            centered around nature, science, and the human experience. It reflects on the beauty and
                            complexity of
                            existence, often drawing inspiration from the works of Charles Darwin. Key tracks include
                            "Élan,"
                            "Shudder Before the Beautiful," and the epic "The Greatest Show on Earth," which serves as a
                            grand
                            finale exploring evolution and life on Earth. "The Greatest Show on Earth" being their
                            longest
                            song to
                            date, running 21 minutes long. </p>
